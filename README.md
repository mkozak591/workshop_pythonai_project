# workshop_pythonai_project
Dominican wokrshop collaboraiton project using python and ai.
With my group at the Dominican workshop, we created a project where you received concise Youtube search results defined by the user's choice in the amount of likes and results by using the Youtube search engine and ai code. I contributed to the project by helping collect information for the code, and also putting together the presentation.
