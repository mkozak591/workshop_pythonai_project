# workshop_pythonai_project
A Dominican workshop collaboration project using python and ai.
With my group at the Dominican workshop, we created a project where the user is able to receive concise Youtube search results. The search results were defined by the user's input such as the type of search, maximum number of results and the minimum amount of likes. We used ChatGPT2, Youtube search engine api key, FAISS vector, etc to print out the search results into a Word document displaying the title, likes, and summary of the video. I contributed to the project by helping collect information through different resources for the code, and also putting together the presentation. I helped with the research by looking through LangChain, different LLMs and searching for solutions from different coding errors. As my other teammates were finishing creating the code, I put together the final presentation. I included all relevant information needed, such as the code, results, and citations. I used different templates to design and colour the background, and center it on a tech theme to appeal to the audience. I presented along with my classmates, explaining step by step the code's purpose to the entire prject, and identifying the different resources that we used.
